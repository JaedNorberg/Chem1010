          In recent years, the shift to thorium as a cleaner source of nuclear
          energy has led to a decrease in demand, leading us to find new ways to
          use this seemingly neverending supply of fluorine. Our world-renowned
          researchers poured all of their resources into repurposing
          fluorine-based products for consumer use.

            <h2>Our History:</h2>
            <p>
              SiliconArtists Inc is an American corporation founded in the
              bustling 1950s to tackle common problems with creative and
              sometimes unorthodox solutions. After inheriting a stretch of land
              deemed functionally worthless, one of the company’s founders
              realized they’d just become the proud owner of an abandoned mining
              operation featuring one of the most abundant elements in the
              earth’s crust—fluorite!
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite warnings that fluorine processing has historically been
              too dangerous to industrialize, the self-described visionary set
              about amassing the world’s greatest collection of fluorine, before
              dying of what our lawyers have advised us to call “natural
              causes.” Now with a stark surplus of supplies, the company’s only
              option was to invest in nuclear energy by manufacturing uranium
              hexafluoride, marrying the post-war abundance of uranium to our
              company’s ill-advised abundance of fluorine. For the next 60
              years, we then supplied products to more than 50 nuclear power
              facilities, becoming a world leader in uranium hexafluoride
              production.

                Our most popular product by far! The highly durable material of
                our milk jugs is made from industrial-grade PVDF (polyvinylidene
                fluoride). This material is resistant to acids, salts, oxidants,

              <p>
                Is your lovely home plagued by vermin? Do they breathe air? Then
                why not marvel at the scientific wonders of gas displacement
                using sulfur hexafluoride? The density of sulfur hexafluoride
                gas means it sinks to the bottom of a container, displacing air
                on top of it. Given copious and expensive amounts of it, is sure
                to evacuate the breathable air from your entire basement*. And,
                while breathing sulfur hexafluoride is not advised, you may find
                it has the opposite effect of helium, making you sound like the
                dark lord himself**!
